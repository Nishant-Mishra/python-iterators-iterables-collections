    "## Protocols\n",
    "Collections in Python can be organized based on the protocols they support. Following are the Protocols in Python specific to Collections:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Container__ Protocol:\n",
    "    - Requires the `Collection` to support __membership__ operation, with `in` and `not in` operators. \n",
    "    - Realized by the Collection by implementing `__contains__()` method.\n",
    "    - Examples: __`list, range, dict, tuple, str, bytes, set, frozenset`__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Sized__ Protocol: \n",
    "    - Requires the `Collection` to support __`len()`__ operation. \n",
    "    - Realized by the Collection by implementing `__len__()` method.\n",
    "    - Examples: __`list, range, dict, tuple, str, bytes, set, frozenset`__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Iterable__ Protocol:\n",
    "    - Requires the `Collection` to return an Iterator, when called with `iter()`.\n",
    "    - Realized by the Collection by implementing `__iter__()` method which returns an Iterator.\n",
    "    - Examples: __`list, range, dict, tuple, str, bytes, set, frozenset`__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Sequence__ Protocol:\n",
    "    - Requires the `Collection` to support following operations:\n",
    "        - Indexing: Any element of the collection can be accessed using `collection[index]` operation\n",
    "        - Element Index: The index of any element can be determined with `collection.index(elem)` operation\n",
    "        - Element Count: Number of occurrances of any element can be determined with `collection.count(elem)` operation\n",
    "        - Reverse Iterator: The collection must support `reversed()` operation\n",
    "    - Examples: __`list, range, tuple, str, bytes`__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. __Set__ Protocol:\n",
    "    - Requires the `Collection` to support *set algebra* operations viz. __union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference, subset, superset,__ etc.\n",
    "    - Examples: __`set, frozenset`__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. __Mapping__ Protocol:\n",
    "    - Requires the `Collection` to support a mapping of keys to values and ability to access a value using the key.\n",
    "    - Example: __`dict`__\n",
    "\n",
    "___NOTE__: All the above protocols support querying (reading/accessing) operations. Out of the above Protocols, the `Set`, `Sequence` and `Mapping` also support `Mutable` versions, i.e. which support in place collection modification._\n",
    "\n",
    "7. __Mutable Sequence__ Protocol: Example: __`list`__\n",
    "\n",
    "8. __Mutable Set__ Protocol: Example: __`set`__\n",
    "\n",
    "9. __Mutable Mapping__ Protocol: Example: __`dict`__"
